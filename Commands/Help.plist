&lt;title&gt;Hotkey Bundle&lt;/title&gt;

## About

The hotkey bundle allows you to store a shell command on control shift 1-5 (US keymap) for the current project.

## How it works

The first time you press control shift 1-5, it will ask you for the shell command to run. After that, the same key will run that command with output shown as a tool tip.  All commands are run from the base of the project directory.

## Internals

The list of recorded shell commands is kept in the project folder as `.tmhotkeys` (in YAML format).
